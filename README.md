# UFOs

## Overview

### Using a combination of JavaScript and HTML, we were able to create a webpage that allows us to bring in data and filter on certain criteria. We began with building the frame. From there, we added HTML and JavaScript notation in order to bring the data in correctly and add the filters.

## Results

### One of the main tasks for this challenge was creating a number of filters to be able to drill down on the data. The final product consisted of five filters, all of which allow the user to input their desired criteria to drill down in the data.

## Summary

### There are always pros and cons to how websites work. One drawback is that you have to know what you are searching for. Within the filters, you cannot select a certain value since it only takes input values. There are two recommendations I would make to improve the website. First, I would allow for sorting the table; whether that be by date or alphabetically by city. Second, I would allow for criteria searches. An example of this would be searching for certain words within the Comments column.
